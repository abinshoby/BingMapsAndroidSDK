This project is a unoffical fork for the Bing Maps Android SDK to make the original SDK works on 4.0+ devices (Will optimized for 4.4+)

Also, I'm planning to migrate this SDK from current Bing Maps V7 to the most recent Bing Maps V8, it's already partially works, you can check it on the V8WebControl branch.
