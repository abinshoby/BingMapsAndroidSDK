This project is a unofficial fork for the Bing Maps Android SDK to make the original SDK works on 4.0+ devices (Will optimized for 4.4+)

Also, I'm planning to migrate this SDK from current Bing Maps V7 to the most recent Bing Maps V8, it's already partially works, you can check it on the V8WebControl branch.

The demo app using V8WebControl is uploaded to Google Play store
